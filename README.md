# Training-of-Language-Model
Explanation of Key Steps:
Data Preparation:
Create a dataset class (CustomTextDataset) to preprocess the text file and tokenize it using a pretrained tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2 tokenizer).

Model Selection:
Use a transformer model like GPT-2 for causal language modeling, which is suited for autoregressive tasks.

Training Loop:
Utilize torch.optim.AdamW for optimization and a linear learning rate scheduler for gradual adjustment of learning rates.
Perform training on a GPU if available, otherwise fallback to CPU.

Model Saving:
Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use.

Tools Used:
PyTorch: For training and optimization.
Hugging Face Transformers: For model and tokenizer implementations.
Custom Dataset Loader: For handling and tokenizing custom data.

Challenges:

Data Preparation:
Handling text encoding and ensuring that the dataset is free from irrelevant symbols or errors.
Hardware Constraints:
Training a language model from scratch requires substantial compute resources (e.g., GPUs or TPUs).
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Finding optimal learning rates, batch sizes, and block sizes for efficient training.
