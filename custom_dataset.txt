# CUSTOM DATASET USED

Artificial intelligence is transforming the world. 
Language models are a significant part of AI research and development.
Training a language model requires a large amount of data.
Deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow simplify model training.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a key area where language models are applied.
Applications of NLP include chatbots, translation, and summarization.
The success of language models depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset.
Custom datasets can be tailored for domain-specific applications.
Efficient training pipelines are necessary to handle large datasets and compute resources.
Fine-tuning pretrained models on custom datasets can improve performance.
